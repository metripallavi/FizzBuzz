# FizzBuzz Example

## Overview
This project showcases my implementation of the FizzBuzz program using JavaScript.

## Getting Started
To see the FizzBuzz program , create a `index.html` file.

## Definition 
Fizz Buzz is a programming problem where a series of numbers are iterated, and for each number that is divisible by 3, its called as "Fizz"; for each number divisible by 5, its called as "Buzz"; for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, the combination "FizzBuzz" is output. For all other numbers that do not meet these conditions, the number itself is output.

## FizzBuzz Logic
I have written the FizzBuzz logic in the `test.js` file, which operates in the following manner:
- The program smoothly goes through numbers from 1 to 100.
- Whenever a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it displays "FizzBuzz".
- If a number is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".
- If a number is divisible by 5, it shows "Buzz".
- For all other cases, it straightforwardly prints the number itself.

## File Structure
This project contains two primary files:
- `index.html`: It's an HTML file responsible for visually representing the FizzBuzz Example.
- `test.js`: This JavaScript file holds the core FizzBuzz logic.

## Usage
open the `index.html` file in any JavaScript-compatible web browser
